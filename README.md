## Summary
This application is intended to deploy and configure a simple apache server.


## Installation
You'll need to have ansible downloaded onto your machine.  You can then pull these files directly, or fork the repo to your local machine.

## Application
Once you have ansible and the playbook installed, you can use the apacheconf file to adjust your configuration settings as needed.  
Finally, you can run the playbook using the 'anisble-playbook' command and specify the inventory file using the target host for configuration.  I've used 'hosts.ini' as my inventory file.
